# Cybersecurity Notes Repository

**Author:** Bricen Chitty  
**Purpose:** To document my ongoing learning process in cybersecurity, starting from foundational topics like Linux and networking, and progressing into more advanced areas such as defensive security, offensive techniques, and cloud security. This repository serves as my personal knowledge base and portfolio of growth as I develop my cybersecurity skill set.

## Overview

As I journey through various cybersecurity concepts, hands-on labs, and practical exercises (e.g., Hack The Box Academy modules), I will store my notes, references, and reflections here. By leveraging GitHub’s version control, I can track my progression over time and maintain a well-organized set of study materials.

**Key Goals:**
- Build a strong foundation in Linux and networking.
- Understand core security principles, frameworks, and best practices.
- Document hands-on exercises, experiments, and troubleshooting steps.
- Create a reference guide I can revisit as I tackle more complex scenarios.
- Demonstrate continuous learning and improvement to future employers and mentors.
